# a4523_final_bhj8
Jupyter notebooks for a NN dispersion measure guesser, created for an ASTRO 4523 final project.

The "Toy Model" notebook is intended to be easily readable, with code ordered sequentially and comments where appropriate.
Hitting "Run All" should suffice for a demo.

The "regression_practice" and "simulating_bursts" notebooks are scratch work for the accompanying paper, 
not intended to be run in order.

Some networks therein are adapted from articles by Piotr Skalski and Adrian Tam (links below). I am grateful for their
contributions to making machine learning and data science a more accessible place!
